Incase you want to host your own version of the server:

1. clone this repo
2. deploy it to vercel with 'other' framework preset
3. set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable on vercel to the api key (brijesh and I have it currently)
4. change the link in your dev branch code to request from your vercel backend
